# Abstract
Purpose: To guess CGPA.

Features:
-	Store the data locally for privacy
-	Real-time CGPA calculation on every credit or letter change
-	Ability to rename, edit and save old guesses

# Usage
## Making a New Guess
- 1- Select 'Make New Guess' from the drop-down menu in the 'Existing Guesses' section.
- 2- Then, use the 'add row' button to add course rows.
- 3- Type the course name, and select the letter and the credit, respectively. Note that if you choose a letter not used in CGPA calculations, the credit box will be automatically adjusted to 0. You will not be able to change the corresponding credit unless you select a letter used in CGPA calculations.
- 4- While adding courses, your CGPA will be calculated automatically. If any problem is preventing the auto-calculate feature from working, you may use the 'Calculate' button manually.
- 5- Click the 'Save As' button to save your guess. Contrary to mainstream apps, in my app, you cannot click the save button in the first run because, in my app, the meanings of saving buttons differ from regular apps. The button 'Save' always overwrites the selected file, while the 'Save As' creates a new file before writing data. Hence, since there is no file to overwrite while saving new files, you must use the 'Save As' button to save your new guesses.
# Usage Tips
- Create a new guess, fill it with your actual transcript data and save it using the 'Save As' button. Afterward, rename it to something like "semester x transcript." Whenever you want to make a new guess in the current semester, add rows directly to this file, and then use the 'Save As' button to save your guess while keeping the "semester x transcript" file unchanged.
